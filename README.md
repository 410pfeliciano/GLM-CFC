# GLM-CFC

A GLM based approach to measure CFC

simfun: code to simulate signals V_low, V_high, with induced cross-frequency coupling and measure output statistics R_PAC, R_AAC, and R_CFC, along with confidence intervals and p-values

glmfun: code to evaluate coupling statistics R_PAC, R_AAC, and R_CFC, along with confidence intervals and p-values, between two signals

ExampleCode: run to get example voltage traces and surfaces in Phi_low, A_low, A_high space (as in Figure 4)
